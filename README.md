# Portfolio-Generator

## Purpose
This project displays the skills I need to be successful by building a program that creates an HTML portfolio page directly from the command line. I didnâ€™t actually write any HTML or CSS. Instead, I used Node.js to dynamically generate the portfolio using input that the user enters when prompted.

## Features
* **PLEASE NOTE:** Because this is a Node.js application that runs from a machine and not a browser, I can't deploy this to GitHub pages. If anyone  wants to look at the application, you'll have to clone it to your own local machine and run it from there.
* Modularized my code into multiple files.
* Wrote my code using ES6+ concepts, such as let, const, and arrow functions.
* Used npm (Node Package Manager) to initialize a project and install and import Node.js modules.
* Built an interactive command-line application that processes user input using a third-party Node.js module.
* Used string literals to dynamically generate markdown from the command line.

## Built With
